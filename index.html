									<h2 class="major">I'm a pomsky...</h2>
									<p>...which means I'm part Husky and part Pomeranian. The "Pomsky" breed was officially established in
										2012, so it's still young and has lots of variations. For me, I'm a fourth-generation Pomsky, which
										means my parents, grandparents, AND great-grandparents were also all Pomskies. My great-great-grandmothers
										were Huskies and my great-great-grandfathers were Pomeranians. You can read more about my breed
										at the American Pomsky Kennel Club's website 
										<a href="https://americanpomskykennelclub.org/" target="_blank">here.</a>
									</p>
									<p>I was adopted from <a href="https://mycrazypomskys.com/" target="_blank">My Crazy Pomskys</a>, which
										happens to be the only APKC-registered breeder in New York State, which is where I was born and where
										my owner is from too.

								<h2 class="major">I'm currently 17 weeks old.</h2>
								<p>My birthday is May 4, 2025, which makes me about 4.5 months old. I was adopted in July, when I was 10.5 weeks
									old, and have lived with my owner and her grandmother in the Adirondacks ever since.
								</p>	
								<p>I love the wilderness here <em>SO</em> much, and have a ton of fun exploring the woods, bouncing through the shrubs,
									climbing up hills, hiking new trails, learning how to swim, and taking boat rides with my family and friends.

									<h2 class="major">I LOVE to play with toys!</h2>
									<p>I'm lucky to have <em>LOTS</em> of toys to play with. I love fetching, tugging, chewing, and shaking them.
										My favorites are Ducky and Moosie, along with my tugging rope and my owner's silk hair scrunchies!
									</p>
									<p>In addition to my toys, I love to help my owner with projects and chores around the house. I especially love
										tearing up boxes and paper, crunching empty water bottles, sneaking
										licks from my owner's beer and Diet Coke cans, and gnawing on broom bristles. Oh, and of course,
										when I'm outside, I <b><u>LOVE</u></b> finding and tossing around pine cones.
